# Travel-19

This project is an android app created for people who travels a lot. Application provides some valuable information about airport and country restrictions, covid statistic, and gives you information if you can travel in spesific country.

## Architecture

The architecture of the application is based, apply and strictly complies with each of the following 5 points:
-   A single-activity architecture, using the [Navigation component](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation/navigation-getting-started) to manage fragment operations.
-   [Android architecture components](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/guide), part of Android Jetpack for give to project a robust design, testable and maintainable.
-   Pattern  [Model-View-ViewModel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93viewmodel)  (MVVM) facilitating a [separation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns) of development of the graphical user interface.
-   [S.O.L.I.D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID)  design principles intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible and maintainable.

## Third-party libraries
Min API level is set to 21, so the presented approach is suitable for over 94% of devices running Android. This project takes advantage of many popular libraries and tools of the Android ecosystem. Most of the libraries are in the stable version unless there is a good reason to use non-stable dependency.
-   [Jetpack](https://developer.android.com/jetpack):
    -   [Android KTX](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/ktx.html)  - provide concise, idiomatic Kotlin to Jetpack and Android platform APIs.
    -   [AndroidX](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx)  - major improvement to the original Android  [Support Library](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/support-library/index), which is no longer maintained.
    -   [View Binding](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/view-binding)  - allows you to more easily write code that interacts with views/
    -   [Lifecycle](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/lifecycle)  - perform actions in response to a change in the lifecycle status of another component, such as activities and fragments.
    -   [LiveData](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata)  - lifecycle-aware, meaning it respects the lifecycle of other app components, such as activities, fragments, or services.
    -   [Navigation](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation/)  - helps you implement navigation, from simple button clicks to more complex patterns, such as app bars and the navigation drawer.
    -   [Splash screens](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/splash-screen) - This API enables a new app launch animation for all apps when running on a device with Android 12 or higher
    -   [DataStore](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/datastore)  - Allows you to store key-value pairs or typed objects with [protocol buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers).
    -   [Room](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/room)  - persistence library provides an abstraction layer over SQLite to allow for more robust database access while harnessing the full power of SQLite.
    -   [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel)  - designed to store and manage UI-related data in a lifecycle conscious way. The ViewModel class allows data to survive configuration changes such as screen rotations.
-   [Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines-overview.html)  - managing background threads with simplified code and reducing needs for callbacks.
-    [Coroutines Flow](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines-overview.html)  - cold asynchronous data stream that sequentially emits values and completes normally or with an exception
-   [Dagger2](https://dagger.dev/)  - dependency injector for replacement all Factory classes.
-   [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/)  - type-safe HTTP client.
-   [Glide](https://github.com/bumptech/glide)  - image loading and caching library
-   [Shimmer](https://github.com/facebook/shimmer-android)  - Add shimmer effect for views library
- [LeakCanary](https://github.com/square/leakcanary) in debug mode for detecting memory leaks.

## Environment Setup
First off, you require the latest Android Studio 4.0.1 (or newer) to be able to build the app.

Application uses 3 different API-s. To use there API-s you should add endpoints in the `local.properties` project root file:

```properties
#Application API Endpoints
AMADEUS_ENDPOINT = "https://test.api.amadeus.com/v1/"
NOXTON_ENDPOINT = "http://covid-restrictions-api.noxtton.com/v1"
COUNTRIES_ENDPOINT = "https://restcountries.com/v3.1/"
```
For Amadeus API You need to supply API key to displayed countries restriction in the app. You can find information about how to gain access via this link - [Amadeus API](https://developers.amadeus.com/self-service/category/covid-19-and-travel-safety/api-doc/travel-restrictions) 

When you obtain the Amadeus API, first you should create a new folder, **cpp**, inside **app/src/main**. Then right-click on the cpp folder, click on New â†’ C/C++ Source File, and name your file lib.cpp.

Inside your **lib.cpp**, add the following code:
```c++
#include <jni.h>
#include <string>

using namespace std;
extern "C" JNIEXPORT jstring JNICALL
Java_ge_bootcamp_travel19_utils_Keys_clientSecret(JNIEnv *env, jobject thiz) {
    string client_secret = "your client secret";
    return env->NewStringUTF(client_secret.c_str());
}

extern "C" JNIEXPORT jstring JNICALL
Java_ge_bootcamp_travel19_utils_Keys_clientId(JNIEnv *env, jobject thiz) {
    string client_id = "your client id";
    return env->NewStringUTF(client_id.c_str());
}
```
